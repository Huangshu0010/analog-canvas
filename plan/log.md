# Maintenance Log

This file records factual, accepted project maintenance history.

Use concise entries:

```text
## YYYY-MM-DD - Target title

- Target: what the work set out to do.
- Changed areas: files, directories, or subsystems changed.
- Validation: commands or review performed.
- Commit status: committed, ready to commit, not committed, or blocked.
```

Keep reusable lessons in `docs/experience/`, not in this log.

## 2026-08-06 - Bootstrap repository workflow

- Target: initialize the circuit asset project as a GitHub repository and
  adopt the plan-log-experience workflow from `agent-workflow-kernel`.
- Changed areas: added project documentation, repository-wide Agent rules,
  plan and experience templates, Git attributes, and the initial project
  assets under `lib/` and `netlists/`.
- Validation: `git diff --check` passed; every SPICE `.subckt` had a matching
  `.ends`; every local `.include` resolved; required workflow sections were
  confirmed; repository scope and status were reviewed.
- Commit status: ready to commit as `Initialize circuit project workflow` and
  push to the private `chenzc24/interactive-circuit-maker` repository.

## 2026-08-06 - Document overall circuit canvas architecture

- Target: consolidate the product definition and design discussion into one
  overall implementation plan for the AI/human collaborative circuit canvas.
- Changed areas: added `docs/overall-product-plan.md` and its bounded target
  plan under `plan/2026-08-06-document-overall-product-plan/`.
- Validation: confirmed balanced Markdown fences and required architecture
  contracts; reviewed headings and terminology; `git diff --check` passed.
- Commit status: ready to commit as
  `Document overall circuit canvas architecture`.
